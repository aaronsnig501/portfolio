        <h3>&gt;&gt;&gt; aaron_sinnott.skills["python"]</h3>
        <p>Over the years I have work primarily in Python and Django. In addition to this, I have also spent some time working with Flask and also some a little experience with some other frameworks like CherryPy and Bottle.\n</p>
        <p>I've worked primarily with the Django ORM with MySQL databases, but I have also worked in PostreSQL and a little in MongoDB, with some experience with SQLAlchemy.\n</p>
        <p>I have experience deploying these applications to both Heroku and AWS EC2, as well as automating build processes through Travis.\n</p>

        <h3>&gt;&gt;&gt; aaron_sinnott.skills["fullstack"]</h3>
        <p>Most of the projects that I have worked on have all been across the fullstack, so I experience with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I have experience working on responsive sites with frameworks like Bootstrap and Materialize, as well a mobile-first principles when working with media queries.\n</p>
        <p>I have recently been working in React and am currently working on building up some projects using React, Next.js and ES6+.\n</p>

        <h3>&gt;&gt;&gt; aaron_sinnott.skills["aws"]</h3>
        <p>I have experience in working with multiple everyday AWS services like EC2, Route 53 and S3, as well as some extra services like Translate, Polly and Comprehend.\n</p>
        <p>I have deployed Django and bottle applications to EC2 using Apache, React projects to Amplify and registered and assigned domains using Route 53.\n</p>
        <p>I am also very interested in delving further into this in the future to look at extra automation services like CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, etc., so that I can manage all of my deployments using automation.\n</p>

        <h3>&gt;&gt;&gt; aaron_sinnott.work["history"]</h3>
        <p>The first project that I was assigned to work on was a Django project that was running on EC2s, with an Angular 1 frontend and PostgreSQL database with my second project also being a Django project which was hosted on Linode, which a pure HTML, CSS and JS/jQuery frontend and and MySQL database.\n</p>
        <p>After this I spent some time working on a couple of C# projects, both on desktop, and an dashboard using ASP.NET MVC and ChartJS.\n</p>
        <p>After working in .NET, I went back to working in Python and Django for Code Institute where I work on building learning material aimed at career changes that were new to coding. During this period, in addition to building course material, I also worked on the learning platform which is built in Django and hosted on EC2, with both a MySQL and MongoDB.\n</p>
        <p>I left my role as a developer in Code Institute to move to Brazil to be with my girlfriend, but I continue to work with them as a mentor, helping students to build their projects to a professional standard, as well as offering career related advice, and mock interviewing them in preparation for real-world interviews.</p>
        <p>In addition to mentoring, I've also been working on <a href="http://decyphr.net/">decyphr</a>, an app that I started to help myself to learn Portuguese, which I hope to be able to offer on a larger scale in the future.\n</p>
